## Differences Between p-value, Significance Level, and Power

The **p-value**, **significance level**, and **power** are fundamental concepts in statistical hypothesis testing, each with a distinct role. Below is a clear breakdown of their differences:

### 1. p-value
- **Definition**: The probability of observing a test statistic (or result) as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed in the sample, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
- **Purpose**: Measures the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. A smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence to reject the null.
- **Interpretation**:
  - If p-value ≤ significance level (α), reject the null hypothesis.
  - If p-value > α, fail to reject the null hypothesis.
- **Example**: If p = 0.03 and α = 0.05, the result is statistically significant (reject the null).

### 2. Significance Level (α)
- **Definition**: The predetermined threshold (probability) for rejecting the null hypothesis, representing the acceptable risk of a Type I error (false positive, rejecting a true null hypothesis).
- **Purpose**: Sets the cutoff for determining statistical significance.
- **Common Values**: Typically 0.05 (5%) or 0.01 (1%), depending on the field.
- **Interpretation**: If the p-value is ≤ α, the result is statistically significant.
- **Example**: Setting α = 0.05 means accepting a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis.

### 3. Power
- **Definition**: The probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false (detecting a true effect). Calculated as 1 − β, where β is the probability of a Type II error (false negative, failing to reject a false null hypothesis).
- **Purpose**: Measures the test’s ability to detect a true effect.
- **Range**: Ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values (e.g., 0.8 or 80%) indicating better detection ability.
- **Factors Affecting Power**:
  - Sample size (larger samples increase power).
  - Effect size (larger effects are easier to detect).
  - Significance level (higher α increases power but risks false positives).
  - Data variability (lower variability increases power).
- **Example**: A study with 80% power has an 80% chance of detecting a true effect if it exists.

| Concept               | Represents                                  | Role in Hypothesis Testing                            | Typical Values                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **p-value**           | Evidence against null hypothesis            | Compared to α to decide significance                  | Varies (e.g., 0.03, 0.12)         |
| **Significance Level (α)** | Threshold for rejecting null hypothesis     | Sets the cutoff for p-value comparison                | 0.05, 0.01                        |
| **Power**             | Probability of detecting a true effect       | Measures test’s sensitivity to true effects           | 0.8 (80%) or higher is desirable  |

### Summary Example
Suppose you’re testing whether a drug improves recovery time (null hypothesis: no effect).
- You set α = 0.05 (5% risk of false positive).
- After the study, you calculate a p-value of 0.02. Since 0.02 < 0.05, you reject the null hypothesis and conclude the drug has a statistically significant effect.
- The study’s power was 0.9 (90%), meaning there was a 90% chance of detecting the drug’s effect if it truly exists.

These concepts work together to balance the risks of Type I and Type II errors while ensuring reliable statistical conclusions. Let me know if you need further clarification or examples!
